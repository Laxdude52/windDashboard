# windDashboard

Right now, there is a script in R and Python that collects data from Kentucky's first large-scale wind turbine, recently installed, every minute. Then every 5 minutes it updates a DQL database to store historical data and writes it to a local file as well for reduncancy. 

This is the dashbaord link: https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/dbd942bf-db44-4d5a-bccb-066180ad3802
