# windDashboard

Right now, there is a script in R and Python that collects data from Kentucky's first large-scale wind turbine, recently installed, every minute. Then every 5 minutes it updates a DQL database to store historical data and writes it to a local file as well for reduncancy. 

I am now working on linking the SQL database to a dashbaord I will develop
